# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

1. Go to your GitHub repository at https://github.com/Ahmedin-Jamil/BaguioPetBoarding
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"
4. Check these settings:
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: gh-pages
   - Folder: / (root)
   - Custom domain: baguio-pet-boarding.com
   - Enforce HTTPS: Should be checked if possible

5. Scroll down to see if there are any build/deployment errors

If the settings look correct but the site isn't working, check if there's a yellow/orange banner at the top indicating that your site is still being published.
